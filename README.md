# Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This is the final unit of the University of Toronto DSI Machine Learning Certificate Diploma, and a team project. All contributors are visible within the repository. 

Our project aims to use [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning) to determine the best way to cluster patients based on their symptoms, as well as determining symptoms that are the most important predictor of a disease. Our findings are documented below.
